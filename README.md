# Variational Autoencoder for MNIST
Variational Autoencoder for identifying images in MNIST dataset. The python code loads the MNIST dataset from the library. The VAE model is then used for identifying images in the dataser.
Variational Autoencoder have the property of being continuous in the latent space which enables them to generate new images. The infomration in the latent space
is of greater importance than the output itself in such generative models. VAE model is created using Keras framework
 Just checking for commit in VS code
